Marvin Pafla is a PhD candidate in the David R. Cheriton School of Computer Science at the University of Waterloo. Drawing on his background in both Psychology and Computer Science, he investigates humanâ€“machine interaction, with a particular focus on neural network explainability and its implications for user trust and comprehension. His research explores the notion of "understanding understanding," examining how humans and AI can make sense of each other through a shared Theory of Mind. To advance this work, he studies the ontological foundations that support mutual understanding. Marvin is supervised by Professor Mark Hancock and Professor Kate Larson.
